# ColorVisionCNN

Codebase for exploration of color vision in CNNs - written to work in Google Colab.

If you clone this repository, I *highly recommend* cloning only the master branch unless you want to also get the saved model parameters:

> git clone -b master --single-branch git@github.com:cephcyn/ColorVisionCNN.git

Originally implemented as part of my final project in CSE599B: "AI & The Brain" taught by Prof. Rajesh Rao in 2020AU
